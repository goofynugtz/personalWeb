## ...
Background: Archishman used a massaging neck rest before.  
## ...

We, 4 guys, were roaming in the ladies and babies section.  
Archishman saw a Neck rest, and wanted to get one.  
We see some neck pillows which **DO NOT VIBRATE**. ```(one also had kitty on it :) )```

At last, without finding any Neck rest, we end up at spencers not expecting to get one there either.  
## But
We found one but it still does not vibrate. But Sayantan had to make sure.  
So, He asks the lady.  
Sayantan: **DOES IT VIBRATE?**  
Lady ```( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)```: No.

Defeinitely not a good look. :/
